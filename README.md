# Spam-mail-prediction-using-ML
# ABSTRACT 
Spam e-mail detection involves applying algorithms and rules to locate and delete unwanted or unwelcome e-mails. These algorithms and guidelines frequently look at an e-mail's content, the sender's reputation, and other factors to determine if it is likely to be spam. For users' inboxes to be free of unwanted or potentially hazardous information, the ability to recognize spam e-mails is essential. Spam e-mail detection is critical for protecting customers from unsolicited and potentially harmful information that can clog their inboxes and compromise their security. Mails are Categorized as 'Spam' or 'Ham' in the dataset. By performing analysis and applying machine learning algorithms for building the predictive system, the model will predict the upcoming mail as spam or ham according to the research on the data. Various machine learning classification algorithms are used, out of which the SVM(linear) gives the most accurate results.
# INTRODUCTION
Technology is advancing at a high rate. A few decades back, the only source of communication was the letters, which turned into telegrams, and in recent times it is in various forms like emails, phone calls, SMS, etc. An average person sends 72 messages per day, as texting is also the most common cell phone activity. Almost 300 billion emails are exchanged per day, and half of them are spam emails. 'Spam Mail' is basically undesired and unwanted emails that are sent to many of recipients that is just filling up all the inboxes. Most of these messages are product buying links, which would consume our personal data or could be some links and attachments. Sometimes carelessness from some users can cause significant damage to their personal data. Spam mails not only fill your inbox with junk mails but also cause email traffic. Spam messages accounted for 45.1% of email traffic in March 2021. In short, such mails can be frustrating and dangerous at the same time. Inboxes are 85% filled with Spam mails and due to which the valuable and important emails are ignored. we have come up with our model that would classify emails and messages into either spam or ham. The evaluation metrics for performance such as accuracy were considered evaluating the proposed study.
# EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
In our experimental analysis spam mail detection, we employed a variety of machine learning algorithms including k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Multinomial NB. The objective is to consider the details or content of the emails, and to develop a classification model that will be able to predict or classify whether an e-mail is spam or not. After preprocessing the data by cleaning, encoding, and splitting into training and testing sets, we trained each model and evaluated its predictive performance using accuracy as the primary metric. SVM(Linear) consistently emerged as the top-performing model, exhibiting the highest accuracy rates. Its ability to handle complex interactions among features and mitigate overfitting contributed to its superior performance.
# CONCLUSION
SVMs have been successfully applied in spam detection systems either as standalone classifiers or as part of ensemble methods to enhance performance. Their ability to handle high-dimensional data, flexibility in defining decision boundaries, and robustness to overfitting, model complex relationships through non-linear kernels, and effectively handle imbalanced datasets make them a valuable tool in the arsenal of techniques used to combat spam emails effectively.
SVMs a powerful and popular choice in the field of machine learning as it yields an accuracy of 98.2% for developing robust and accurate spam filtering systems.
